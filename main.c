 * 1) Modify the procedure driveRoad such that the following rules are obeyed:
 *
 *   	A) Avoid all collisions. 
 *
 * 	B) Multiple cars should be allowed on the road, as long as they are
 *  	traveling in the same direction.  
 *
 * 	C) If a car arrives and there are already other cars going IN THE
 *  	SAME DIRECTION, the arriving car should be allowed enter as soon as it
 * 	can. Two situations might prevent this car from entering immediately:
 *  	(1) there is a car immediately in front of it (going in the same
 *   	direction), and if it enters it will crash (which breaks rule A);
 * 	(2) one or more cars have arrived at the other end to travel in the
 *  	opposite direction and are waiting for the current cars on the road
 * 	to exit, which is covered by the next rule.  
 *
 *  	D) If a car arrives and there are already other cars traveling in the
 * 	OPPOSITE DIRECTION, the arriving car must wait until all these other
 *  	cars complete their course over the road and exit. It should only wait
 *   	for the cars already on the road to exit; no new cars traveling in the
 * 	same direction as the existing ones should be allowed to enter.  
 *
 *  	E) The previous rule implies that if there are multiple cars at each
 * 	end waiting to enter the road, each side will take turns in allowing
 *  	one car to enter and exit. However, if there are no cars waiting at
 * 	one end, then as cars arrive at the other end, they should be allowed
 *  	to enter the road immediately.  
 *
 *   	F) If the road is free (no cars), then any car attempting to enter
 * 	should not be prevented from doing so. 
 *
 *  	G) All starvation must be avoided.  For example, any car that is
 * 	waiting must eventually be allowed to proceed. 
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
 * 
 * 1) Avoid busy waiting.  In class one of the reasons given for using
 * semaphores was to avoid busy waiting in user code and limit it to
 * minimal use in certain parts of the kernel. This is because busy
 * waiting uses up CPU time, but a blocked process does not.  You have
 * semaphores available to implement the driveRoad function, so you
 * should not use busy waiting anywhere. 
 *
 * 2) Prevent race conditions.  One reason for using semaphores is to
 * enforce mutual exclusion on critical sections to avoid race conditions. 
 * You will be using shared memory in your driveRoad implementation.  
 * Identify the places in your code where there may be race conditions
 * (the result of a computation on shared memory depends on the order
 * that processes execute). Prevent these race conditions from occurring
 * by using semaphores.  
 *
 * 3) Implement semaphores fully and robustly. It is possible for your
 * driveRoad function to work with an incorrect implementation of
 * semaphores because controlling cars may not exercise every use of
 * semaphores.  You will be penalized if your semaphores are not correctly
 * implemented, even if your driveRoad works. 
 *
 * 4) Control cars with semaphores: Semaphores should be the basic
 * mechanism for enforcing the rules on driving cars.  You should not
 * force cars to delay in other ways inside driveRoad such as by calling
 * the Delay function or changing the speed of a car. (You can leave in
 * the delay that is already there that represents the car's speed, just
 * don't add any additional delaying).  Also, you should not be making
 * decisions on what cars do using calculations based on car speed (since
 * there are a number of unpredictable factors that can affect the
 * actual cars' progress).
